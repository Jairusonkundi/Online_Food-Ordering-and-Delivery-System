# Online_Food-Ordering-and-Delivery-System
The admin side of the PHP and MySQL Online Food Ordering System is separate from the visitor/client side. All of the website's data, as well as the list of accessible menus, will be managed by the administrator. The customer will browse the website, investigate and choose the menus that he or she desires, and then add them to a shopping basket for eventual checkout. The client will next proceed to the basket, examine his or her purchase, confirm the delivery address and other details, and submit his or her order. This is an easy-to-use project.
